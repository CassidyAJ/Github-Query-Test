This is a test repo for the Github query project, which aims to receive info from Github's API in order to pull Github open source projects into Gitlab projects.
This repo will contain a python file that prints "Hello world" and a pull request that changes it to "Hello, world" as an example of a pull request with a comment, which is necessary testing data for the Github API project.
